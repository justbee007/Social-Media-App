# MERN App README

Welcome to the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) App repository! This repository contains a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack.

## Overview

The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript-based framework for building dynamic web applications. It consists of the following components:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.

This README provides an overview of the MERN application, its structure, setup instructions, and other relevant information.

## Application Structure

The MERN application is structured as follows:

- **Backend**: Node.js server using Express.js framework for handling API requests and MongoDB for data storage.
- **Frontend**: React application for the user interface, interacting with the backend API.
- **Database**: MongoDB database for storing application data.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the MERN application locally:

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`.
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`.
   - Configure MongoDB connection: Update the MongoDB connection URI in `config.js`.
   - Start the backend server: `npm start`.

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`.
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`.
   - Start the React development server: `npm start`.

4. **Access the Application**:
   - Once both backend and frontend servers are running, access the application at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Usage

The MERN application provides various functionalities, including user authentication, data CRUD operations, and more. Explore the application to understand its features and usage.
